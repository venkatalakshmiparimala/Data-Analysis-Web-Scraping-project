📘 Data Analysis & Web Scraping 
This repository contains two assignments that demonstrate skills in data engineering, data extraction, and web scraping using Python and R. Both projects reflect a practical application of real-world data processing and dynamic web content extraction.

📌 Assignment 1: JSON Flattening and Data Enrichment (DMCA Notices)
📂 Objective
•	Process a deeply nested JSON file containing DMCA takedown notices.

•	Flatten and enrich the data.

•	Generate analytical summaries using both Python and R.

🧠 Approach
1. Pre-analysis
•	Used JSONLint to understand and validate the structure.

•	Reorganized the JSON into a more readable format for inspection.

2. Flattening the JSON
•	Iterated through notices, works, and infringing URLs.

•	Extracted key metadata: notice ID, sender, principal name, work description.

Output: flattened_step1.csv.

3. Adding Domain and IP
Extracted domain from each infringing URL.

Resolved domain to IP using:

•	Python: socket.gethostbyname() with ThreadPoolExecutor.

•	R: nslookup() with parSapply() on a 4-core cluster.

Output: flattened_step3.csv.

4. Summarizations
•	Top 10 infringing domains.

•	Unique notices per sender.

•	Infringing URLs grouped by work description.

•	Additional metrics: most active senders/domains.

🛠️ Tech Stack
•	Languages: Python, R

•	Python Libraries: pandas, json, urllib.parse, socket, concurrent.futures

•	R Packages: jsonlite, dplyr, urltools, parallel

✅ Outcome
Successfully built a scalable and parallelized data pipeline.

Generated CSV summaries with clean code in both languages.

📌 Assignment 2: Web Scraping Journal Articles (SAGE)
📂 Objective
Scrape article metadata from the Journal of Marketing (SAGE) current issue page, including:

•	Title

•	Authors

•	First Published Date

•	DOI

•	Abstract

🧠 Approach
❌ Attempt 1: requests + BeautifulSoup
Could not retrieve article data due to JavaScript-rendered content.

✅ Final Solution: Selenium + BeautifulSoup
•	Controlled Chrome via Selenium to simulate browser behavior.

•	Accepted cookies and waited for JS execution.

•	Extracted and parsed article content using BeautifulSoup.

Saved data into a structured CSV.

🛠️ Tech Stack
•	Python 3.x

•	Selenium + ChromeDriver

•	BeautifulSoup (bs4)

•	pandas

•	requests (explored, not used in final solution)

✅ Outcome
•	Extracted full article metadata.

•	Saved output as assignment2_articles_final.csv.

•	Selenium proved reliable for dynamic web scraping.

📎 Deliverables
✅ Clean and well-documented Python & R scripts

✅ Output CSVs for both assignments

✅ Summary documents outlining approach and results
